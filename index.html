<h1>What is Windows 9</h1>
<p>Windows 9 is an OS made by Microsoft. I can hear you now saying "oh but Windows 9 never existed!." To a certain extent, yes, it does not exist as it was not released to the public as Windows 9 but instead Windows 10 (because of the "Windows 7 8(to sound like ate) 9" joke).
Because Windows 9 is the beta of Windows 10, many features found inside of Windows 9 will more than likely be found in in Windows 10.
Windows 9 was only released on the Windows Insider's program and the page to download it was soon taken down though the download links were still there, and therefor the files. Because the page itself was taken down, the Windows 9 Downloader is made to be able to download the files using a single click.
Just chose the x86 or x64 version.</p>
<br />
</p>Because it is Windows 9 Technical Preview (it IS a beta) it is an evaluation copy so you'll only have it for about 6 months.</p>


<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>For some reason , setup.exe crashes after 2012. Because of this, when installing, be sure to set the CMOS date to January of 2012. Any date should work.
You can NOT set the time to the normal time after installation or else the evaluation copy will run out of time. I recommend installing this on a virtual machine instead of a physical PC because of this.</p>
